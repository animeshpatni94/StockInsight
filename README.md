# 📊 Stock Insight Agent

AI-powered **bi-weekly** stock analysis with portfolio memory, politician trade tracking, risk management, and actionable recommendations designed specifically for **retail investors**.

## 💰 Biweekly Fresh Budget System

Every time the agent runs, you invest **$1,000 fresh money** on top of your existing holdings:

| Category | Budget | Actions |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Existing Holdings** | Already invested | HOLD / SELL / TRIM / ADD |
| **New Picks** | Fresh $1,000 | BUY new positions |

### How It Works

1. **Fresh Money Each Run**: You add $1,000 new capital every 2 weeks
2. **Review Existing Holdings**: Claude analyzes your current positions and recommends:
   - **HOLD** — Keep the position as-is
   - **SELL** — Exit completely (take profits or cut losses)
   - **TRIM** — Reduce position size (e.g., sell 50%)
   - **ADD** — Double down using fresh budget money
3. **Allocate New Budget**: The fresh $1,000 is distributed across:
   - New stock picks (never owned before)
   - Adding to existing winners (ADD action)
4. **10-15 Stock Recommendations**: Claude provides diversified picks across sectors and risk levels

### Example Allocation

```
Fresh Budget: $1,000 (spread across 10-15 positions)
├── NVDA (Core position): $150
├── GOOGL (Core position): $125
├── PLTR (Growth play): $100
├── AMD (Growth play): $100
├── BTC-USD (Crypto - Large cap): $100     ← NEW: Crypto
├── ETH-USD (Crypto - Large cap): $75      ← NEW: Crypto
├── XLK (Sector ETF): $75
├── MSTR (Speculative): $50
├── SOL-USD (Crypto - Mid cap): $50        ← NEW: Crypto
├── IONQ (Speculative AI): $50
├── RKLB (Small-cap growth): $50
└── ARKG (Thematic ETF): $75
```

### ADD (Double Down) Support

When Claude recommends "ADD" on an existing position:
- Uses money from your fresh $1,000 budget
- Tracks weighted average cost basis
- Maintains complete add history with dates and amounts

### Configuration

Set your biweekly budget in `src/config.py`:

```python
BIWEEKLY_INVESTMENT_BUDGET = 1000  # Fresh money to invest each run
```

### Data Flow (No Selection Bias)

```
yfinance screens 1500+ stocks (with real prices)
           ↓
Claude selects stocks purely on fundamentals/technicals
           ↓
Verify prices with yfinance (safety net)
           ↓
Fetch sentiment ONLY for selected stocks (Alpha Vantage)
           ↓
Display sentiment as supplementary info in email
```

**Why this order?** Fetching sentiment BEFORE Claude would bias stock selection toward stocks with sentiment data. By fetching AFTER, Claude makes unbiased decisions based purely on market data.

### 4-Year Historical Financials

For portfolio holdings and top 50 screen candidates, Claude also receives **4 years of annual financial data**:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Revenue History** | 4-year revenue trend (in billions) |
| **Net Income History** | 4-year profitability trend |
| **EPS History** | Earnings per share (diluted) over 4 years |
| **Free Cash Flow History** | FCF generation trend |
| **Gross Profit History** | Margin consistency over time |
| **EBITDA History** | Operating earnings power |
| **Revenue Growth Trend** | Year-over-year growth rates |

### Example: NVDA Historical Data

```
Periods: 2022 → 2023 → 2024 → 2025
Revenue:      $26.9B → $27.0B → $60.9B → $130.5B
Net Income:   $9.8B  → $4.4B  → $29.8B → $72.9B
EPS:          $0.39  → $0.18  → $1.21  → $2.97
FCF:          $8.1B  → $3.8B  → $27.0B → $60.9B
Growth:       -      → 0.2%   → 125.9% → 114.2%
```

This historical data allows Claude to:
- ✅ Validate growth claims with actual multi-year trends
- ✅ Identify companies with consistent vs erratic growth
- ✅ Spot margin expansion/compression over time
- ✅ Detect companies transitioning from losses to profits
- ✅ Avoid "one-hit wonders" with unsustainable growth

## 📐 Diversification Rules

Claude Opus 4.5 acts as the **sole advisor** with minimal guardrails:

| Rule | Limit | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Single stock | Max 15% | Prevent single-stock blowup |

**Everything else is Claude's decision** - asset allocation, sector weights, number of positions, investment style. The AI has full discretion based on:
- Your user profile (age, risk tolerance, financial situation)
- Current market conditions
- Portfolio history and past performance
- Real-time market data

## 🛡️ Risk Management

The agent includes **automatic risk management** that adjusts strategy based on portfolio performance:

### Risk Status Levels

| Status | Trigger | Actions |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 🟢 **NORMAL** | Default state | Standard allocation rules apply |
| 🟡 **CAUTION** | Drawdown ≥10% OR 3 consecutive losses OR win rate <40% | Reduce position sizes, avoid speculative plays, increase cash to 15%+ |
| 🟠 **DEFENSIVE** | Drawdown ≥15% OR 4+ consecutive losses OR win rate <30% | Max 7% positions, 25%+ cash, conservative picks only, halt aggressive trades |
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Drawdown ≥20% | Emergency mode: 40%+ cash, max 5% positions, treasuries/dividend aristocrats only |

### How It Works

Each run calculates risk metrics and Claude receives **mandatory rules** based on the current status:

```
⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT STATUS: 🟠 DEFENSIVE

Metrics:
- Drawdown from Peak: -16.2%
- Consecutive Losses: 4
- Win Rate: 28.5%

MANDATORY RULES FOR DEFENSIVE MODE:
- Maximum position size: 7%
- Minimum cash allocation: 25%
- Aggressive positions allowed: NO
- Speculative positions allowed: NO
- Maximum new positions this period: 2
```

## 💵 Cost Estimate

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|--------------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 API | ~$5-15 |
| Resend (100 emails/day free) | $0 |
| GitHub Actions | $0 |
| Alpha Vantage (free tier) | $0 |
| **Total** | **~$5-15/month** |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Claude API timeout/network error:**
- The system automatically retries 3 times with exponential backoff (10s, 20s delays)
- If all retries fail, a safe fallback preserves your existing portfolio
- Check GitHub Actions logs for details

**Empty email sections:**
- First run will show welcome section instead of performance data
- Portfolio builds over time with each run

**No politician trades:**
- Verify Claude is returning `politician_trade_analysis.notable_trades` in response
- Capitol Trades may have rate limits

**S&P 500 showing 0%:**
- Fixed in latest version - now correctly uses "S&P 500 (SPY)" key
- Historical data won't be retroactively fixed, but new runs will be accurate

**No news sentiment:**
- Check `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` is set
- Free tier: 25 calls/day limit

**Prices showing N/A or $0:**
- All prices should come from yfinance via `portfolio_performance`
- Check that `calculate_performance()` is being called in main.py
